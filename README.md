Web 2.0 and the cloud coined the term "as a service" - PaaS, SaaS, etc. Today Web 3.0 is following suite and various solutions are coming to light that offer generic services from blockchains to bootstrapping liquidity for DeFi protocols allowing entrepeneurs to bring ideas to market a lot quicker.
