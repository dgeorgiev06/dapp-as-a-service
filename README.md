# DeFi technologies as a service 

Web 2.0 and the cloud coined the term "as a service" - PaaS, SaaS, etc. Today Web 3.0 is following suite and various solutions are coming to light that offer generic services from blockchains to bootstrapping liquidity for DeFi protocols allowing entrepreneurs to bring ideas to market a lot quicker.

I am creating this repo to track Web 3.0 solutions that can be used "as a service".  These services can offer no code setup with UI and composable smart contracts when more control/customization is required.

You'll find resources below organized in the following categories: DAO governance, DAO treasury, DEX, Infrastructure, Token liquidity, Contract/Transaction automation, Oracles

Additionally, we developed a new concept called Voting Vaults that allows governance users to delegate assets for governance while retaining the ability to use the same assets for any other purpose in DeFi, such as earning yield or leveraging.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

In short, Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|
|<img src="./images/tally.png" width="200" height="100">|[Tally](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides-1/supported-dao-frameworks)|Tally supports DAOs on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Tally connects with the on-chain contracts for your DAO in two places. Tally’s servers index the on-chain data, and Tally’s web3 site lets users make calls directly to the contracts running on the blockchain. Here, we describe the interface that your contracts need to follow to be compatible with Tally. The easiest way to be compatible is to fork Open Zeppelin Governor or Compound’s Governor Bravo without changing anything. If you do need to change something, check the dependencies here in the docs to make sure that your changes are compatible with Tally’s data indexing and web3 calls.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|
