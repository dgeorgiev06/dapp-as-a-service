# DeFi technology as a service 

Web 2.0 and the cloud coined the term "as a service" - PaaS, SaaS, etc. Today Web 3.0 is following suite and various solutions are coming to light that offer generic services from blockchains to bootstrapping liquidity for DeFi protocols allowing entrepreneurs to bring ideas to market a lot quicker.

I am creating this repo to track Web 3.0 solutions that can be used "as a service".  These services can offer no code setup with UI and composable smart contracts where more control/customization is required.

## DAO Governance as a service

Additionally, we developed a new concept called Voting Vaults that allows governance users to delegate assets for governance while retaining the ability to use the same assets for any other purpose in DeFi, such as earning yield or leveraging.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|
|<img src="./images/zeppelin_gov.webp" width="200" height="100">|[OpenZeppelin Governor](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/)|OpenZeppelin Governor provides compatibility with Compound’s GovernorAlpha and GovernorBravo for easy migration of protocols and dapps while offering ease of customization, modularity, and significant gas cost reductions. Many modules are presented in two variants, one of which is fully compatible with Compound’s governance systems.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

|<img src="./images/snapshot.png" width="200" height="100">|[Commonwealth.io](https://docs.snapshot.org/)|Snapshot is a decentralized voting system. It provides flexibility on how voting power is calculated for a vote. Snapshot supports various voting types to cater to the needs of organizations. Creating proposals and voting on Snapshot is user-friendly and does not cost gas as the process is performed off-chain. In short, Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

## DAO Treasury as a service

If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

The protocol supports token exchanges for ERC20, ERC721, and other Ethereum token standards. | Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

## Liquidity as a service

|<img src="./images/olympus_pro.png" width="200" height="100">|[Olympus Pro](https://www.olympusdao.finance/olympus-pro)|Olympus Pro introduces the innovative bonding mechanism of Olympus as a service for other protocols. Similar to bonding on Olympus, Olympus Pro allows a user to exchange existing liquidity for the protocol’s native token at a discount. In exchange, the protocol owns the liquidity instead of renting it, which helps secure longevity and price stability for everyone involved.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|
