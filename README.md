# DeFi technology as a service

Web 2.0 and the cloud coined the term "as a service" - PaaS, SaaS, etc. Today Web 3.0 is following suite and various solutions are coming to light that offer generic services from blockchains to bootstrapping liquidity for DeFi protocols allowing entrepreneurs to bring ideas to market a lot quicker.

I am creating this repo to track Web 3.0 solutions that can be used "as a service".  These services can offer no code setup with UI and composable smart contracts where more control/customization is required.

## DAO Governance as a service

## DAO Treasury as a service

|<img src="./images/gnosis_safe.png" width="200" height="100">|[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome)|Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.|Ethereum or EVM Equivalent|

## DEX as a service

|<img src="./images/0x.png" width="200" height="100">|[0x](https://www.0x.org/)|0x is a permissionless liquidity protocol built on Ethereum for creating decentralized exchanges, connecting liquidity providers and incentivizing market makers to fuel DeFi asset trading. 0x itself is not a decentralized exchange, simply the infrastructure for building decentralized exchanges and connecting liquidity providers across a range of sources. The protocol supports token exchanges for ERC20, ERC721, and other Ethereum token standards. |

## Liquidity as a service

|Diagram| Name          | Description    | Runtime  |

|<img src="./images/olympus_pro.png" width="200" height="100">|[Olympus Pro](https://www.olympusdao.finance/olympus-pro)|Olympus Pro introduces the innovative bonding mechanism of Olympus as a service for other protocols. Similar to bonding on Olympus, Olympus Pro allows a user to exchange existing liquidity for the protocol’s native token at a discount. In exchange, the protocol owns the liquidity instead of renting it, which helps secure longevity and price stability for everyone involved.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|
|<img src="./images/ondo_fei.png" width="200" height="100">|[Liquidity-as-a-Service](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/if-you-are-part-of-a-dao-or-protocol-that-wants-to-create-liquidity-for-your-token-without-f49a01f02863)|offering from Ondo and Fei to make it possible for projects issuing tokens to increase the liquidity in their native tokens on decentralized exchanges by providing liquidity themselves. With Laa$, a project can deposit its token into an Ondo liquidity vault with a flexible duration, and Fei will match those deposits with an equivalent amount of FEI to form a liquidity pair.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|
|<img src="./images/uma_kpi_options.png" width="200" height="100">|[UMA KPI Options](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)|Key Performance Indicator (KPI) options are synthetic tokens that will pay out more rewards if a project’s KPI reaches predetermined targets before a given expiry date. Every KPI option holder has an incentive to improve that KPI because their option will be worth more. This is intended to align individual token holder interests with the collective interests of the protocol.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|

Tokemak helps bootstrap or deepen existing liquidity through Token Reactors that act as ‘advanced’ liquidity pools which utilize dynamic APR incentives to attract and seamlessly pair assets to be deployed as liquidity across a range of decentralized exchanges.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|
