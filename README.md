# DeFi technology as a service

Web 2.0 and the cloud coined the term "as a service" - PaaS, SaaS, etc. Today Web 3.0 is following suite and various solutions are coming to light that offer generic services from blockchains to bootstrapping liquidity for DeFi protocols allowing entrepeneurs to bring ideas to market a lot quicker.

Similar to bonding on Olympus, Olympus Pro allows a user to exchange existing liquidity for the protocol’s native token at a discount. In exchange, the protocol owns the liquidity instead of renting it, which helps secure longevity and price stability for everyone involved.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|

Every KPI option holder has an incentive to improve that KPI because their option will be worth more. This is intended to align individual token holder interests with the collective interests of the protocol.|Ethereum and EVM equivalent|
